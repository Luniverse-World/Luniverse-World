# Luniverse-World

Luniverse is a P2E online open world game built with a proprietary system that integrates gaming built on unity with a WebGl-Web3 system entirely developed in house by our team. We are building a blockchain infrastructure that supports multichain, to date the project utilises 3 different tokens (erc 20, erc 721 and erc 1155) and special smart contracts to manage all P2E payments quickly and securely.  

The very basis of the metaverse is built from the land up, we thought weâ€™d do land differently. Give people yield generating opportunities right from the word go! These are standalone NFT islands that can be mined starting from April 5, 2022. Important game updates with new features and seeds will be released each month.
